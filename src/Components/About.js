          . I started my coding journey on August 15th 2018. I had a huge
          interest since my childhood on building something that`s being used by
          a lot of people and can add value to their lives. And when I got first
          introduced to programming my intrest got a way to expand and I started
          working on it day and night.First I started learning free from Youtube
          videos.{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">
            (Big shout out to Mysirg, Code with harry and Hitesh Chowdhary
            Youtube channels)
          </span>{" "}
          After I learned some basic fundamentals of programming, I started
          working on few projects (which now looks crappy to me ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£).
        </p>
        <p>
          After working on some projects, I realised that things are not going
          in my favour ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”... Because I was knowing the basic concepts of
          programming but lacking the industry standard best practices and
          trends. I think that learning from youtube videos are great but there
          is a con that there is so much distractions comming your way. So I
          decided to go for some paid courses on udemy, learn code online etc.
          From those courses I started learning and building awsome projects.
          After completing those courses by following along with the instructor,
          I was getting inspiration to build some projects on my own and I did
          that. Finally landed a fulltime job in a good startup{" "}

          >
            Colorbracket technologies
          </a>
          . In that company I build an entire pick and drop system for chennai
          client and few more projects which gave me a lot of confidence that I
          can build exciting projects on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that I left Colorbracket in one year looking for better
          oopurtunities there and now I am working in this awesome company
          hoping for best.
